/** Filesystem adapter usable from flow scripts — the handle behind the `fs`
  * accessor. Reads, writes, and globs files against the flow's working
  * directory.
  *
  * All paths passed to `read`, `write`, and `list` are resolved relative to the
  * flow's working directory unless they are absolute. `list` accepts a glob
  * pattern (e.g. `src/**/*.scala`) following the JVM's default glob syntax and
  * returns matching file paths as strings relative to the same working
  * directory.
