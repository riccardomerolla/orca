  * structured-call surface (`LlmCall.resultAs[O]`) after parsing.
  *
  * The renderer no longer second-guesses the agent's output — every delta the
  * agent emits lands in the event log verbatim, JSON or not. When a parsed `O`
  * *also* has an `Announce[O]` instance with a non-empty message, the library
  * emits a `Step` event with that message after the agent's turn ends, giving
  * the human a friendly read of the same value.
  *
  * The default given (below) returns an empty string, which the library treats
  * as "no announcement to make" — so adding the `Announce` context bound to
  * `LlmCall.resultAs` doesn't break any caller. Provide a specific given
  * (typically in the case class's companion) when a friendlier read is worth
  * showing.
