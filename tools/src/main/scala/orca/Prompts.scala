package orca

/** Builds the literal prompt strings Orca sends to the LLM for each invocation
  * mode. Each method takes the serialized user input, the generated JSON
  * Schema for the expected output, and the active `LlmConfig`, and returns
  * the final prompt text. Swap the default ([[orca.io.DefaultPrompts]]) by
  * passing `prompts = ...` to `flow(...)` when you want to customise
  * phrasing, add guardrails, or use a different structured-output
  * convention.
  *
  * The schema is a parameter (rather than something the backend always
  * threads in via `--json-schema`/`--output-schema`) because not every
  * code path enforces structured output at the CLI: claude headless
  * (`-p --output-format json`) doesn't, codex `exec resume` rejects the
  * flag, and codex headless calls don't carry one. Embedding the schema
  * in the prompt is the only signal those paths get; for paths where
  * the backend also enforces it, it's belt-and-suspenders.
