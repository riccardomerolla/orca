/** Subprocess invocation helpers that **guarantee captured stderr**.
  *
  * Why this exists: os-lib 0.11.x defaults `os.proc(...).call(...)`'s
  * `stderr` to `os.Inherit`. A flow tool that uses `os.proc` directly
  * therefore lets the child write its stderr straight to the parent's
  * terminal — bypassing the renderer's [[orca.runner.terminal.StatusBar]]
  * and producing visible artifacts (a stray "Switched to a new branch"
  * appearing on the same physical row as the spinner glyph, mid-redraw).
  *
  * The rule, encoded as a code-level helper rather than a comment:
  *
  *   *Any tool that shells out from a flow goes through `QuietProc.call`
  *   (or a `CliRunner`, which now wraps it). Direct `os.proc(...).call(...)`
  *   in production tool code is a leak — the tool's terminal output
  *   becomes invisible to the StatusBar's clear-line discipline and the
  *   user sees torn frames.*
  *
  * Subprocess errors aren't dropped: stderr is captured into
  * `result.err`, which the caller surfaces in error messages (see
  * [[orca.tools.git.OsGitTool]]'s `git` helper).

object QuietProc:

  /** Run `args` to completion. stdout + stderr are captured into the
    * returned [[os.CommandResult]]; `check = false` means non-zero
    * exits don't throw — the caller inspects `exitCode` /
    * `err.text()` and decides how to react. Mirrors the os-lib
    * `call` shape so migration from `os.proc(...).call(...)` is
    * mechanical.
