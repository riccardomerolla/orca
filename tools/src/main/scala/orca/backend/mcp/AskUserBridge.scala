  * worker thread that needs a string answer to return to the agent) and the
  * host process (the conversation driver that emits `UserQuestion` events and
  * feeds back what the user typed).
  *
  * One queue carries `(question, reply)` pairs from the handler side; each call
  * brings its own private reply channel so concurrent `ask_user` invocations
  * from a busy agent don't cross wires. The handler thread blocks on its reply
  * channel until the host signals it; the host's consumer loop takes from the
  * question queue, surfaces a `UserQuestion`, and calls the `respond` closure
  * with the typed answer.
  *
  * **Closure.** [[close]] errors any still-blocked `reply.receive()` calls and
  * `done`s the question queue, so the drainer loop and Netty workers exit
  * cleanly when the owning conversation ends. The owner
  * (e.g. `ClaudeConversation.onFinalize` or `CodexConversation.onFinalize`)
  * calls `close` after the conversation's read loop drains — before the MCP
  * server's Netty binding stops, so handlers see the bridge close first.
