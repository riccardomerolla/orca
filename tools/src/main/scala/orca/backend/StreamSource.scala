/** The line-oriented source a [[StreamConversation]] drives.
  *
  * Abstracts the four things the driver needs from its producer — a primary
  * line stream, an optional secondary diagnostic stream, a way to stop it, and
  * a terminal status — so one driver serves both a subprocess
  * ([[StreamSource.fromProcess]], used by the Claude/Codex backends) and any
  * other line producer (the OpenCode `GET /event` SSE connection).
  *
  * Thread-safety: [[lines]] and [[errorLines]] are each single-consumer (one
  * reader thread per stream). [[interrupt]] must tolerate calls from any
  * thread, concurrent with iteration and more than once. [[tryExitCode]] is
  * read only after [[lines]] ends.
