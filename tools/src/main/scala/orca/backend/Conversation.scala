  * [[ConversationEvent]] produced by the subprocess in order. The iterator
  * terminates when the session ends; the final outcome is read via
  * `awaitResult`.
  *
  * Tool-approval decisions are delivered via the closure carried on
  * [[ConversationEvent.ApproveTool]] — the channel does not track request-ids.
