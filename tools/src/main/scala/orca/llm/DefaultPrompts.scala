/** Default [[Prompts]] implementation. Each method builds the final prompt
  * string via Scala string interpolation.
  *
  * Autonomous calls ship the JSON Schema inline in the prompt — they route
  * through `claude -p --output-format json` with no structured validation on
  * the CLI side. Interactive calls rely on `--json-schema` for enforcement and
  * let the agent reply in natural conversation until it has the final
  * structured value; the schema is still summarised in the prompt so the model
  * knows the target shape, but no magic marker is required.
