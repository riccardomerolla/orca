/** One live interactive session with a backend. Owned by the driver, read

  * `events` is a single-consumer blocking iterator that yields every
  * [[ConversationEvent]] produced by the subprocess in order. The iterator
  * terminates when the session ends; the final outcome is read via
  * `awaitResult`.
  *
  * Tool-approval decisions are delivered via the closure carried on
  * [[ConversationEvent.ApproveTool]] — the channel does not track
  * request-ids. `sendUserMessage` injects an unsolicited user turn; it
  * and `cancel` are safe to call from any thread.
