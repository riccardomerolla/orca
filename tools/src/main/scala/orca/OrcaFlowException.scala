  * The `alreadyEmitted` flag tells the stage machinery whether an
  * `OrcaEvent.Error` has already been published for this failure: true when
  * thrown by `fail(...)` (which emits before throwing), false for direct throws
  * from tool code. A `stage` (and the top-level flow boundary) reads it to skip
  * a duplicate emit, and sets it to true once it does publish an Error — so an
  * enclosing stage, or the flow boundary, surfaces a tool-side failure exactly
  * once instead of re-reporting it at every level it unwinds through.

/** A semantic failure of an agent *turn that actually ran*: the conversation

  * rate limit, a non-zero CLI exit, or a clean exit with no result).

  * Distinct from a pre-spawn *open* failure (e.g. a transient broken pipe
  * before the session was registered), which stays a plain
  * [[OrcaFlowException]]. The distinction drives retry: the autonomous retry
  * loop reuses the same session id, which the backend locks once the turn has
  * run, so reopening it only yields "session already in use" / "broken pipe".
  * `AgentTurnFailed` is therefore NOT retried — it propagates immediately with
  * the real cause instead of that misleading cascade. Open failures and parse
  * failures remain retryable.
