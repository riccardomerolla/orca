/** Test scaffold for backend constructors that require `using Ox,

  * scope's lifetime, which forces those constraints onto every test that
  * instantiates them). Opens a `supervised:` scope, provides a default
  * `BufferCapacity`, invokes the supplied factory, and yields the resulting
  * backend to the test body.
  *
  * Per-suite `withBackend` wrappers stay readable as one-liners around this
  * helper; the shared scope ensures the magic capacity constant lives in one
  * place.
