/** Interactive planning + coding flow.
  *
  * Same shape as `implement.sc` but the planner opens a conversation the user
  * can drive: if the prompt is underspecified, the agent calls the `ask_user`
  * tool to clarify before producing the plan. Each follow-up question shows
  * up in the terminal; typed answers feed straight back to the agent.
  *
  * Lives alongside the seeded calculator crate so a user can run it from the
  * project's root after `examples/02-interactive/create-test-project.sh`:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run implement-interactive.sc -- "Add a new arithmetic operation to the calculator crate"
  * ```
  *
  * The prompt above is deliberately open-ended — the agent should ask which
  * operation (multiply? divide? modulo?) before planning.
  *
  * Requires `claude` logged in and `cargo` on PATH.
