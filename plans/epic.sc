/** Run an epic: a multi-task workstream with cross-agent review.
  *
  * Two layers stack here:
  *
  *   - **On-disk epic.** `.orca/plan-<hash>.md` holds the task list; on a
  *     fresh run the agent generates it, on a resume the existing file is
  *     recovered (pending edits stashed, branch re-attached) and execution
  *     restarts from the first incomplete task. Each task's `Status: [x]`
  *     checkbox is committed back to the plan file as the task lands, so a
  *     crash mid-flow loses no progress.
  *   - **Cross-agent review.** Claude implements; codex reviews. The
  *     implementing agent is its own worst critic — running reviewers on a
  *     separate model widens coverage without much extra cost. Fixes go back
  *     to the same Claude session. Both CLIs need to be logged in.
  *
  * At the end of a successful run the plan file is removed, then the
  * documentation step updates the project README based on what changed.
  *
  * `examples/04-epic/create-test-project.sh` seeds the todo-cli project
  * into a temp directory and copies this script alongside it; run from
  * the seeded directory the seeder prints:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run epic.sc -- \
  *   "Persist tasks to a JSON file at ~/.todo/tasks.json (load on startup, save on every change), \
  *    add 'done <id>' and 'delete <id>' commands, and support priority levels (low/medium/high) \
  *    with a 'list --priority' filter"
  * ```
