/** GitHub-issue → PR flow, fully autonomous.
  *
  * Given a `<owner>/<repo>#<number>` reference (the user's prompt), the flow:
  *
  *   1. Reads the issue from GitHub (title, body, author).
  *   2. Skeptically assesses the report against the repo — verifies claims,
  *      looks for missing detail, duplicates, scope problems. The agent
  *      returns either a plan to implement or a critique / follow-up
  *      question / rebuff.
  *   3. On rejection: posts the agent's reply on the issue and exits cleanly,
  *      no PR.
  *   4. On proceed: creates the epic branch and implements each task with the
  *      review-and-fix loop, committing per task.
  *   5. Pushes the branch.
  *   6. Asks a cheap model (`claude.haiku`) to summarise the diff into a PR
  *      title + description.
  *   7. Opens the PR via `gh`.
  *
  * Usage — pass `<owner>/<repo>#<number>`:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run issue-pr.sc -- "acme/widgets#42"
  * ```
  *
  * Requires `claude` and `gh` both authenticated.
