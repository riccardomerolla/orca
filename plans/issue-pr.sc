/** GitHub-issue → PR flow.
  *
  * Given a `<owner>/<repo>#<number>` reference (the user's prompt), the flow:
  *
  *   1. Reads the issue from GitHub (title, body, author).
  *   2. Plans an implementation, decomposing the issue body into a list of
  *      tasks on a single branch. Re-uses the planning session for
  *      implementation so the agent doesn't have to relearn context.
  *   3. Implements each task, runs the review-and-fix loop, commits.
  *   4. Pushes the branch.
  *   5. Asks a cheap model (`claude.haiku`) to summarise the diff into a PR
  *      title and description — the implementing model already paid for the
  *      thinking, so the PR write-up doesn't need an opus-class call.
  *   6. Opens the PR via `gh`.
  *
  * Usage — pass `<owner>/<repo>#<number>`:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run issue-pr.sc -- "acme/widgets#42"
  * ```
  *
  * Requires `claude` and `gh` both authenticated.
