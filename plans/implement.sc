/** Persistent planning + coding flow (autonomous planning).
  *
  * Mirrors the README example. The agent breaks the user's prompt into a list
  * of tasks; the plan is persisted to `.orca/plan-<hash>.md` so a re-run with
  * the same prompt resumes from the first incomplete task. Each task is
  * implemented in sequence on a single epic branch with a review-and-fix loop,
  * the plan's checkbox is ticked, and the work plus the tick are committed
  * together. When every task is done the plan file is removed and the removal
  * is committed.
  *
  * Lives alongside the seeded calculator crate so a user can run it from the
  * project's root after `examples/01-simple/create-test-project.sh`:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run implement.sc -- "Add a multiply function to the calculator crate"
  * ```
  *
  * Requires `claude` logged in and `cargo` on PATH.
  *
  * For the variant where the planner can ask the user clarifying questions
  * (open-ended prompts, underspecified asks), see `implement-interactive.sc`.
