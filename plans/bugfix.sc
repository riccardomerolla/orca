/** Bugfix flow: red-test-first, against a real PR.
  *
  * Given a bug report (the user's prompt), the flow:
  *
  *   1. Triages the bug — interactively asks the agent whether a failing test
  *      can reproduce it, what the reproduction steps are otherwise, and where
  *      to put any reproduction artefact. 2. Writes the failing artefact (a
  *      unit test if possible, a `REPRODUCTION.md` otherwise) and commits it.
  *      3. Pushes a branch, opens a PR. 4. Waits for CI to come back red —
  *      fails the stage if CI was green (the agent claimed the test reproduced;
  *      CI says otherwise). 5. Comments on the PR with the failing-test output,
  *      and asks the agent to confirm the failure matches the original report.
  *      Fails the stage on a mismatch. 6. Implements the fix on the same
  *      branch. Reviews + lints. 7. Pushes the fix; waits for CI to go green.
  *
  * Lives alongside the seeded buggy project so a user can run it from the
  * project's root after `examples/02-bugfix/create-test-project.sh` (push the
  * seed to a real GitHub repo first — the seed script prints the `gh repo
  * create` line):
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run bugfix.sc -- \
  *   "Calculator.add returns a wrong value when one argument is Integer.MIN_VALUE"
  * ```
  *
  * Requires `claude` and `gh` both authenticated; the target repo must have a
  * CI workflow that runs the test suite.
