/** Bugfix flow: red-test-first, against a real PR.
  *
  * Given a bug report (the user's prompt):
  *
  *   1. Triages — agent decides whether a failing test can reproduce.
  *   2. Lands a failing artefact (unit test, or REPRODUCTION.md if no test
  *      is possible) and commits it.
  *   3. Pushes a branch, opens a PR.
  *
  * When the artefact is a failing test, the flow continues:
  *
  *   4. Waits for CI red — fails the stage if CI is green (the agent's
  *      reproduction claim was wrong).
  *   5. Comments the failure on the PR; asks the agent to confirm the
  *      failure matches the report.
  *   6. Implements the fix on the same branch. Reviews + lints. Commits.
  *   7. Pushes the fix; waits for CI green.
  *
  * When no test is possible, the flow stops after step 3 with a docs-only
  * PR for a human to pick up.
  *
  * Lives alongside the seeded buggy project so a user can run it from the
  * project's root after `examples/03-bugfix/create-test-project.sh` (push the
  * seed to a real GitHub repo first — the seed script prints the `gh repo
  * create` line):
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run bugfix.sc -- \
  *   "Calculator.add returns a wrong value when one argument is Integer.MIN_VALUE"
  * ```
  *
  * Requires `claude` and `gh` both authenticated; the target repo must have a
  * CI workflow that runs the test suite.
