/** Terminal-based `Interaction`. Renders stage transitions, tool uses,
  * streaming LLM output, and errors to a `PrintStream` (defaults to stderr so
  * the structured output on stdout stays clean).
  *
  * The output is split in two zones:
  *   - The **event log** at the top, growing line-by-line as stages start and
  *     tools fire.
  *   - A **status line** pinned at the bottom, showing the current activity
  *     with an animated spinner glyph.
  *
  * Both zones are owned by [[TerminalOutput]], which serialises every write on
  * a single worker thread. When stderr isn't a TTY (CI, redirected output,
  * `NO_COLOR`/`ORCA_NO_ANIMATION`), the output degrades to plain inline writes
  * without ANSI escapes.
  *
  * The default output stream is forced to UTF-8 (see [[start]]): orca's UI is
  * built from non-ASCII glyphs, and when the process is launched under a
  * non-UTF-8 default charset (a `C`/`POSIX` locale — common in containers and
  * editor sandboxes) the JVM's `System.err` would otherwise encode each glyph
  * to `?`.
  *
  * `drive` runs on the caller's thread (no actor ask). It iterates the
  * conversation's event stream and tells the output. The spinner runs on a
  * separate fork inside `TerminalOutput`, so it keeps advancing while drive
  * blocks on the backend.
  *
  * [[close]] is called from `flow(...)`'s `finally` to flush pending writes and
  * clear the status row before the enclosing scope ends.
