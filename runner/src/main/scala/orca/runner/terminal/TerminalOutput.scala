/** The terminal rendering surface. A small set of operations for appending to
  * the event log and advancing the persistent status row at the bottom of the
  * terminal.
  *
  * Production builds ([[TerminalOutput.start]]) serialise every method on an
  * internal Ox actor: a single worker thread owns `out`, log lines and spinner
  * ticks can't interleave mid-write, and a `forkDiscard` animator inside the
  * factory `tell`s the actor every `framePeriodMs` so the spinner keeps
  * advancing while callers do other work.
  *
  * Tests can instantiate [[TerminalOutputState]] directly — it implements the
  * same interface synchronously without an actor or animator fork.
  *
  * **Suspend protocol.** `suspend()` clears the status row and starts buffering
  * subsequent `log` calls; `resume()` drains the buffer and unpauses the
  * animator. Used by the approval prompt so live event output doesn't scribble
  * on top of `readLine`.
