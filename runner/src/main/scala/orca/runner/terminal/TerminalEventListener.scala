/** Renders `OrcaEvent`s — stage transitions, steps, tool uses, errors — via a
  * [[TerminalOutput]] and tracks the active stage stack + indent depth.
  *
  * `EventDispatcher` fans events out to listeners concurrently (see its
  * scaladoc), so this listener serialises its own mutable state (`StageStack`,
  * `StageDepth`) with `lock.synchronized`. The lock guards **only** the state
  * mutation + formatted-string computation — output tells happen after the lock
  * releases, so a slow actor mailbox can't pin the lock and block body-thread
  * reads of [[currentIndent]].
  *
  * Ordering: within one `onEvent` call, the (state mutation, format) + (tell)
  * split preserves visible order — both happen on the same thread. Across
  * concurrent `onEvent` calls from different dispatcher threads, mailbox
  * arrival order matches lock-release order, which is what callers expect.
