/** A persistent single-line status indicator at the bottom of the terminal,
  * with the event log accumulating above. The status line shows the current
  * activity (stage name + spinner glyph); each log write transparently scrolls
  * it down by one row.
  *
  * Two threads touch this bar concurrently: the TerminalInteraction actor
  * worker (for `appendLog`/`startStatus`/`stopStatus`) and the animator fork
  * spawned by [[StatusBar.start]] (for `tick`). A short mutex serialises every
  * field access — the bar can't ride on the actor's serialisation alone because
  * `drive` parks the actor inside a blocking conversation iterator, which would
  * freeze the spinner whenever an interactive LLM call ran.
  *
  * When `animated = false` (non-TTY output, redirected stderr, CI), the bar
  * degrades to plain inline output: every appendLog just writes the line,
  * start/stop/tick become no-ops, and no animator fork is spawned.
