/** Reentrancy/concurrency guards for `flow(...)`.
  *
  * A nested or concurrent `flow(...)` today would stash the outer flow's tree,
  * switch branches under it, and `reset --hard` its work (ADR 0018 §6 flags
  * this as accepted-but-deferred scope). Two layers, acquired at the very start
  * of `runFlow` — before `DefaultFlowContext` even exists, since construction
  * is pure but `FlowLifecycle.setup` mutates git immediately after — and
  * released in a `finally` around the whole body:
  *
  *   - A process-wide flag ([[acquireProcess]]): catches same-JVM
  *     nesting/concurrency cheaply, no I/O, before any git mutation.
  *   - A `workDir`-keyed lock file ([[acquireWorkdir]]): catches the
  *     two-process case a same-JVM flag can't see. Content is the holder's PID;
  *     on contention, a live PID hard-refuses, a dead one is stolen with a
  *     warning (crash leftovers must not permanently wedge a working tree).
  *
  * Both guards fire before `ctx` exists, so a violation is a plain, unwrapped
  * exception out of `runFlow` — `flow()`'s stderr backstop (the `NonFatal`
  * catch below `SurfacedFlowFailure`), not the
  * event-reported/`SurfacedFlowFailure` path, is what a caller of `flow()`
  * sees.

    * [[releaseWorkdir]]). Refuses with the tracker's message when the holder
    * PID is still alive; steals (after a stderr warning) when it isn't.
    *
    * The lock lives under the self-ignoring `.orca/cache/`, so `git add -A`
    * (the stage runtime's commit, `GitTool.commit`) can never sweep it into a
    * commit: [[orca.OrcaDir.ensureCache]] writes the cache's `.gitignore`
    * before the lock file exists. Linked worktrees are covered too — each
    * worktree gets its own `.orca/cache/` with its own `.gitignore`.
    *
    * The only atomic primitive here is `os.write`'s `CREATE_NEW`, so everything
    * else must funnel back through it: a stale lock is stolen by DELETING it
    * and re-racing the create (two racing stealers then can't both win — the
    * loser's `CREATE_NEW` fails and it re-reads the winner's live PID), and a
    * lock that vanishes between the failed create and the read (the holder just
    * released) simply retries the create. Bounded at [[MaxLockAcquireAttempts]]
    * total tries (not retries — `attemptsLeft` below counts attempts remaining,
    * including the one about to run).
