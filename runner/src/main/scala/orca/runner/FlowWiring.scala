/** The per-run tool/agent override bundle `flow(...)` collects from its named
  * arguments. One value tunnels through `runFlow` → `WiredAgents.build` instead
  * of ten positional parameters repeated at each layer; adding a backend is one
  * field here plus one arm in `WiredAgents.build`.
  *
  * Agent overrides are `AgentWiring => Ox ?=> Agent` factories, not prebuilt
  * agents: the runtime hands the factory the run's [[AgentWiring]] (event sink,
  * interaction, workDir, prompts) so a user agent is wired into the same
  * dispatcher as the defaults — costs/steps reach the tracker and terminal. A
  * caller with a prebuilt agent writes `Some(_ => myAgent)`. All five fields
  * share the `Ox ?=>` shape even though only opencode's default factory needs
  * it — the opencode backend pins a `serve` process + drain forks to the run
  * scope at construction, so its factory is applied inside
  * `WiredAgents.build`'s Ox scope, not at the `flow(...)` argument site (see
  * `flow`'s param scaladoc) — a plain `AgentWiring => Agent` lambda auto-adapts
  * to the shape, so the other four fields are unaffected by carrying it too.
  * That auto-adaptation is a property of INLINE lambda literals against an
  * expected type, not of the function type itself: a `val`/`def` stored with
  * the bare `AgentWiring => Agent` type (no `Ox ?=>`) does NOT widen later just
  * by being passed where the context-function shape is expected — the `Ox ?=>`
  * has to be in the value's own declared type from the start.
