/** Entry point for flow scripts. Takes the parsed CLI args (required) plus any
  * number of overrides, then runs the body, providing the `FlowContext` as a
  * given.
  *
  * ```
  * flow(OrcaArgs(args), _.claude):
  *   val plan = agent.resultAs[Plan].autonomous.run(userPrompt)
  *   ...
  * ```
  *
  * Override any tool by passing it as a named argument in the first list:
  *
  * ```
  * flow(
  *   OrcaArgs(args),
  *   git = Some(myGit),
  *   interaction = Some(SlackInteraction(...))
  * ):
  *   ...
  * ```
  *
  * Agent overrides are `AgentWiring => Ox ?=> Agent` factories, not prebuilt
  * agents — see [[orca.runner.FlowWiring]] for why and for the shared `Ox ?=>`
  * shape. Start from a per-backend factory and tune it, `claude = Some(w =>
  * ClaudeAgents.default(w).opus)`, or wrap a prebuilt agent `claude = Some(_ =>
  * myAgent)`. There's no separate `opencodeLauncher` parameter — select a
  * non-default launcher through the factory itself: `opencode = Some(w =>
  * OpencodeAgents.default(w, OpencodeLauncher.ollama("qwen3-coder")))`.
  *
  * The `agent` selector below is constrained the same way: it must resolve to
  * one of the five wired agents (`_.claude`, …) or a `copyTool`-derived sibling
  * of one (`_.claude.opus`, `.withReadOnly`, …) — anything sharing their
  * backend is safe. A selector that instead returns an agent built from a
  * SEPARATE `AgentWiring`/backend (e.g. `_ => myPrebuiltAgent`, or an agent
  * wired against a different run entirely) compiles but is event-blind — it
  * never reaches this run's dispatcher, so its cost/steps never reach the
  * terminal or cost tracker — and gets a loud resolution-time warning; the
  * runtime still closes its backend at flow end to avoid a resource leak, but
  * nothing can retrofit it onto this run's event stream after the fact.
  *
  * The leading agent is named by a required `agent` selector resolved against
  * the run's wired [[AgentSet]]: the only way to name an agent is an accessor
  * on that set, which isn't in scope at the `flow(...)` argument position, so
  * the selector defers resolution until the agents are wired. The runtime
  * resolves it BEFORE the `FlowContext` is constructed (the context receives
  * the resolved lead as a constructor val); `FlowContext` extends `AgentSet`,
  * so the same accessors keep working inside the body. `flow(OrcaArgs(args),
  * _.claude)` runs against claude; `flow(OrcaArgs(args), _.codex)` against
  * codex, etc. Inside the body, reference the resolved lead via the
  * backend-agnostic [[agent]] accessor (not a concrete `claude`/`codex`) so
  * switching the selector switches the whole flow.
  *
  * `B` is the leading agent's backend tag, inferred from the selector
  * (`_.claude` ⇒ `ClaudeCode`) and never written by callers; the runtime pins
  * it into `FlowContext.LeadB` so `agent` is concretely typed and sessions
  * thread.
  *
  * Overrides default to `None` so the runtime can build the default lazily —
  * `TerminalInteraction`, in particular, takes the resolved `workDir` which
  * can't be threaded through a Scala 3 default-arg expression.
