    * Because [[SessionSupport.willContinue]] resolves the recorded mapping

    * Sessions genuinely outlive the process: opencode persists them to a global
    * on-disk store shared by every `opencode serve` on the machine
    * (cwd-independent), so a fresh server spawned after a kill/restart resumes
    * a prior run's `resumeWireId` — `GET /session/<id>` returns 200 with full
    * message history (live-verified 2026-07-08). The probe therefore forces
    * `server.http` (the lazy spawn) rather than gating on whether the server
    * has already started: on resume the registry has a mapped id but no turn
    * has necessarily touched the server yet, so gating on "already spawned"
    * would answer "absent" before ever asking the (perfectly capable) fresh
    * server. This is safe because [[SessionSupport.willContinue]]
    * short-circuits on no mapped id, so the forced spawn only fires when there
    * is a wire id to resume — i.e. precisely when the server is about to be
    * needed for a turn anyway. The per-run server process is an implementation
    * detail, not a durability boundary.
