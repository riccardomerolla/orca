description: SCALA-ONLY. Skip unless `.scala` files are in the changed set. Reviews Scala code for direct-style functional idioms — immutability, total functions, Either/Option over throws, opaque types over primitives, no boolean blindness, explicit dependencies, braceless syntax.

Review the changed Scala code for direct-style functional idioms.

## Aspects

- **No shared mutable state**: no `var` fields on classes/objects, no `mutable.Map`/`Buffer` as fields, no `AtomicReference` / `ConcurrentHashMap` for shared state. Use Ox actors/channels instead.
- **Local mutability is fine if scoped**: `var` inside a method body, threading immutable state through a loop, is acceptable. Flag if a pure `foldLeft`/recursion would be clearer.
- **Pure functions**: parameters in, value out, no hidden `Clock.now`/`UUID.randomUUID`/`Random` — inject those. Use pattern matching/ADTs for control flow, not if/else cascades.
- **Immutable data**: `case class` / `enum` / sealed traits, immutable collections only. Different states of an entity → different types, not `Option` fields.
- **Domain types**: opaque types for `String`/`Int`/`Long`/`Boolean` domain values (`OrderId`, `Port`). No boolean blindness — two-case enums for parameters whose `true`/`false` isn't self-evident at the call site.
- **Failures as values**: `Either[Fail, T]` for recoverable failures; sealed/enum error hierarchies, no stringly-typed errors. Reserve `throw`/`try`/`catch` for unrecoverable boundaries. Use `Option` only for presence/absence, never for error.
- **Direct-style hygiene**: braceless syntax, no non-local returns, explicit return types on public defs/vals/givens, propagate `using Ox` only when starting forks in the caller's scope — otherwise local `supervised`.

## Output

One-line summary ("Found 2 critical issues and 1 info-level note"), then issues grouped by severity (Critical / Warning / Info). Per issue: file:line, the problem in one sentence, and a short code snippet showing the fix.

Only apply to Scala files in the change. Do not review tests, performance, or correctness unless the issue is fundamentally about FP/immutability.
