description: Reviews input validation, injection vectors (shell/SQL/path/template), secret handling, unsafe deserialisation, and privilege/authz mistakes. Especially relevant when code shells out, parses untrusted input, or handles credentials.

## Scope

Security-sensitive operations only. Other dimensions (correctness,
style, performance, tests) belong to other reviewers. If the diff
touches no security-sensitive surface, report no issues.

## Aspects

- **Input validation**: untrusted strings (user input, request bodies, file contents, env vars) used as paths, URLs, regex, SQL fragments, or command arguments without bounds/escape/allowlist. Flag path traversal (`../`), regex denial-of-service, URL host bypass.
- **Injection**: shell exec (`os.proc`, `Runtime.exec`, string-built bash), SQL string concatenation, HTML/template interpolation. Suggest parameterised forms.
- **Secrets**: API keys / passwords / tokens in logs, error messages, exceptions, or persistent state. Hard-coded credentials. Secrets passed via process args (visible in `ps`).
- **Deserialisation**: untrusted JSON/YAML/XML/binary parsed into reflective types, polymorphic ADTs without an allowlist, eval-style operations.
- **Privilege & authz**: writes to system paths, file-permission changes, sudo invocations, missing authorisation checks at a public-API boundary.
- **TLS / transport**: disabled cert verification, plain HTTP for sensitive data, missing timeouts that enable resource exhaustion.

Frame each finding around the vector — what an attacker gains if the issue is exploited.
