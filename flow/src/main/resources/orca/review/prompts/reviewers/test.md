description: Reviews tests for minimality, non-duplication, single-property focus, coverage of new behaviour, and edge-case exercise. Flags redundant, unfocused, or speculative tests; identifies missing coverage of properties the change introduces.

Review the tests added/modified in this change.

## Aspects

- **Minimality**: every test must justify its existence by covering a distinct property no other test covers. Flag redundant tests for removal.
- **No duplication**: two tests exercising the same path with different literals are duplicates. Pick one.
- **Single property per test**: one behaviour per test. Multi-property tests get split; tightly-coupled facets of one scenario are fine.
- **Coverage of new behaviour**: enumerate the properties/branches the changed code introduces; map each to a test; flag uncovered ones.
- **Edge cases**: boundary inputs, empty collections, failure paths, concurrent access — as appropriate to the change.
- **Setup clarity**: heavy fixtures that obscure what's under test should be simplified.

## Output

Per issue: file + test name, one of `redundant | duplicate | unfocused | missing-coverage | unclear-setup`, one-sentence rationale, and a concrete action (remove / split / merge / add). If the tests are already minimal and focused, say so in one line.

Do not review production code quality. Do not request tests for trivial accessors or speculative scenarios not introduced by the change.
