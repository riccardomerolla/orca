/** Outcome of triaging a bug report against a codebase. Three variants:
  *
  *   - [[Triage.NotABug]] — intended behavior, user error, or out-of-scope. The
  *     flow surfaces `explanation` back on the original issue and stops.
  *   - [[Triage.Untestable]] — a real bug, but CI can't host a focused
  *     reproduction (UI-only, races, environment-specific). The flow posts
  *     `reproductionSteps` on the issue and stops; no PR.
  *   - [[Triage.Testable]] — a real bug with a CI-runnable reproduction. The
  *     flow lands a failing test at `failingTestPath`, opens a PR on
  *     `branchName`, then implements the fix.
  *
  * Each variant carries exactly the fields its branch needs, so callers
  * pattern-match instead of guarding the wide-record [[BugTriage]] wire format
  * with runtime `Option#get` / empty-string checks.
  *
  * Produced by [[Plan.autonomous.triage]] / [[Plan.interactive.triage]], both
  * wrapped in a [[Sessioned]] so the triage agent's session can carry into the
  * fix.
