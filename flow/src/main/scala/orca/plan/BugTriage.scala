/** Outcome of an interactive triage turn against a bug report. The agent first
  * decides whether the report describes an actual defect (`isBug`); if so, it
  * picks a reproduction strategy (focused unit test vs. free-form repro steps)
  * and a branch name + PR title for the rest of the bugfix flow.
  *
  * Field combinations the agent should produce:
  *
  *   - `isBug = false` → set `notBugExplanation`; leave the other fields with
  *     reasonable empty defaults. The flow surfaces the explanation back on the
  *     original issue and stops.
  *   - `isBug = true`, `canTest = false` → set `reproductionSteps`; the flow
  *     posts them on the issue and stops (no PR for docs-only repros).
  *   - `isBug = true`, `canTest = true` → set `failingTestPath`, `branchName`,
  *     `summary`. The flow writes the failing test, opens a PR, and proceeds.
