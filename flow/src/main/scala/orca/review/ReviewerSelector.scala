  *     first iteration when there's no history yet.
  *   - `taskTitle` and `changedFiles` come from `reviewAndFixLoop`'s `task` and
  *     the diff it sampled at loop entry. They're passed through on every call
  *     so that selectors which need them (e.g. [[llmDriven]]) don't have to be

  /** Asks `llm` to pick which reviewers are worth running for a given task. The
    * selection is computed on the first call and cached for subsequent
    * iterations — task context doesn't change mid-loop, so re-querying the
    * model would just burn tokens for the same answer.
    *
    * `taskTitle` and `changedFiles` arrive on each invocation from
    * `reviewAndFixLoop`; the call site only supplies the picker LLM (and
    * optionally tunes prompts/descriptions).
    *
    * **Single-loop scope.** The returned selector closes over a per-instance
    * cache. Reusing one selector across two `reviewAndFixLoop` invocations for
    * different tasks would yield iteration 1's pick on both. Build a fresh
    * selector per loop.
    *
    * The picker sees each reviewer as a `(name, description)` pair. By default
    * `descriptions` is [[ReviewerPrompts.descriptionsByToolName]], so users who
    * pass `allReviewers(...)` get rich purpose-aware selection without extra
    * wiring; supply a custom map (keyed by the tool's prefixed name, e.g.
    * `"reviewer: my-thing"`) when overriding the default set. If the picker
    * would see all-empty descriptions, a one-time `Step` warning fires so the
    * silent-name-only-selection failure mode is visible.
    *
    * `filePatterns` is a code-side pre-filter applied before the LLM call:
    * reviewers whose pattern doesn't match any of the iteration's
    * `changedFiles` are dropped, so the picker can't pick them. The default
    * uses [[ReviewerPrompts.filePatternsByToolName]] — only reviewers that
    * declared a `files:` frontmatter entry are constrained; everything else is
    * offered to the picker as-is.
    *
    * Pick a cheap model (e.g. `claude.haiku`); the request is small. Override
    * `instructions` to retune the selection brief.
