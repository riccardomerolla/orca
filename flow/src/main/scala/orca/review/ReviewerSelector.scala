    * mid-loop, so re-querying the model would just burn tokens for the same
    * answer.
    *
    * The picker sees each reviewer as a `(name, description)` pair. By default
    * `descriptions` is [[ReviewerPrompts.descriptionsByToolName]], so users who
    * pass `defaultReviewers(...)` get rich purpose-aware selection without
    * extra wiring; supply a custom map (keyed by the tool's prefixed name, e.g.
    * `"reviewer: my-thing"`) when overriding the default set. Reviewers whose
    * name isn't in the map get an empty description.
    *
    * Pick a cheap model (e.g. `claude.haiku`); the request is small. Override
    * `instructions` to retune the selection brief.
