/** The lint gate `reviewAndFixLoop` runs alongside the reviewers each round:
  * `commands` (each run via `bash -c`, in file/declaration order — e.g. one per
  * stack half of a multi-stack repo, per ADR 0019's `lint` list) and the
  * `agent` that summarises their labelled, concatenated output into a
  * `ReviewResult` (a cheap model — `claude.haiku`, `codex.mini` — since the
  * summary is a small fold). Bundling the pair into one value (rather than
  * `reviewAndFixLoop` taking a separate command-list and agent parameter) makes
  * "commands with no summariser" unrepresentable, so the loop no longer needs a
  * runtime `require` to reject that half-set state.

/** Run each of `commands` via `bash -c`, in order, in the flow's working tree
  * (`ctx.workDir`), capturing each command's combined stdout+stderr; then ask
  * `agent` — in a single pass — to summarise the concatenation as a
  * `ReviewResult`. Every command runs even when an earlier one fails, so a
  * broken first linter doesn't hide the second's diagnostics from the same
  * review round; each block carries its own command and exit status. When every
  * command exits 0 with empty output — including `commands = Nil`, a disabled
  * gate — the call short-circuits to `ReviewResult.empty` and skips the LLM
  * round-trip entirely (a silent nonzero exit still reaches the summariser: a
  * linter can fail with no stdout). Override `instructions` when the lint
  * produces unusual shapes the default phrasing doesn't fit.
  *
  * How the combined text reaches the agent depends on its size:
  *
  *   - **Small (≤ [[Lint.InlineLintThreshold]] chars):** inlined directly into
  *     the prompt. This is the common case (a `cargo check` with a handful of
  *     errors), and inlining is what makes lint work under a sandboxed
  *     autonomous agent — opencode's autonomous mode denies file reads outside
  *     its worktree, so a `/tmp` file reference was silently unreadable and the
  *     lint gate became a no-op ("lint: 0 issues" every round).
  *   - **Large (> threshold):** spilled to a file the agent reads with its
  *     read-only tools (in chunks if needed), because an unbounded build/test
  *     run (hundreds of KB) would overflow the model's context window. The file
  *     holds the same labelled blocks the inline path embeds, and lives under
  *     `<workDir>/.orca/cache/` — NOT `/tmp` — so a sandboxed agent whose
  *     worktree is in-sandbox can still reach it. It's removed in the `finally`
  *     before this call returns.
  *
  * The LLM is invoked read-only: the task is text-in / JSON-out, and the agent
  * may verify a lint claim against the sources it references but should never
  * edit during the summarisation step.
