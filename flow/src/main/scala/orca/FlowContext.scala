  /** Backend tag of the leading agent. You never write this — it's the backend
    * of the agent your `flow(...)` selector picked, and it's why `agent` is
    * precisely typed (`Agent[LeadB]`) so sessions thread. (A type *member*
    * rather than a parameter, so `FlowContext` stays unparametrised — every
    * `using FlowContext` site is unaffected; the runtime captures the concrete
    * tag here at construction, with `flow` generic over it, inferred from the
    * selector.)
    *
    * '''Helper authoring:''' the path-dependent `agent: Agent[ctx.LeadB]`
    * accessor is convenient in a straight-line `flow(...)` body, where every
    * reference resolves against the same `using FlowContext` in scope — but it
    * stops working the moment you factor code into a helper *function*.
    * `ctx1.LeadB` and `ctx2.LeadB` from two different `using FlowContext`
    * parameters are different types to the compiler even when they're the same
    * backend at runtime, so a helper that takes `Agent[ctx.LeadB]` in one
    * parameter and tries to combine it with `SessionId[ctx.LeadB]` from another
    * can't unify them. Two ways out, both used by the library's own helpers:
    *
    *   - Take an explicit `[B <: BackendTag]` type parameter and type the
    *     helper's own parameters against it — `B` is then a genuine type
    *     variable the caller instantiates once, not a path into someone else's
    *     context. See [[orca.review.reviewAndFixLoop]]`(coderSession:
    *     FlowSession[B], ...)`, whose single [[orca.FlowSession]] bundles the
    *     agent and its session so `B` is pinned once at the call site.
    *   - Bundle the agent's session with its result as a single
    *     [[orca.plan.Sessioned]]`[B, A]` value, so callers pass one thing
    *     instead of two that have to agree on `B`. See `Plan.autonomous.*` /
    *     `Plan.interactive.*`.
