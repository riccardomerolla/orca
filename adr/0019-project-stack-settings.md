# 0019. Per-project stack settings with auto-discovery

## Context

Every example flow hardcodes its target project's tooling: `formatCommand =
Some("cargo fmt")`, `lint = Some(Lint("cargo check --tests", agent.cheap))` in
one script, `sbt scalafmtAll` / `sbt Test/compile` in another, `mvn -q
spotless:apply` in a third. The scripts are otherwise stack-agnostic — the
format/lint strings are the *only* thing tying a flow to Rust vs Scala vs
Java. A flow script should contain nothing stack-specific; the commands should
come from per-project settings resolved at run time.

Where such settings can live is constrained by what `.orca/` is today: the
run-scoped scratch directory (progress logs, `flow.lock`, spilled lint
output), which projects are *encouraged* to gitignore. The two files needing git guarantees each have a dedicated
mechanism today: the progress log punches *through* the ignore (a single-path
`git add -f` in the stage-commit protocol), while the lock is guaranteed
*ignored* even in repos that never added the ignore line (an entry in
`$GIT_COMMON_DIR/info/exclude`). Stack settings are the opposite kind
of artifact: user-visible project metadata that *should* be committed and
hand-edited, like `.scalafmt.conf`. An ignored directory is a silent trap for
such a file — git cannot re-include a path whose parent directory is excluded
(`!.orca/settings.properties` under a `.orca/` ignore line is dead), so a
hand-authored settings file would simply never reach the repo, with no signal.

Two further findings shaped the design:

- **Config-as-Scala-code was evaluated and rejected.** The payload is a few
  opaque shell strings — `"cargo chekc"` type-checks perfectly, so the
  compiler verifies nothing useful. Shape-checking would require the settings
  file to depend on orca's types, planting a second orca version pin inside
  the target repo that skews against every visiting script's own pin. eslint's
  flat config — the strongest code-config precedent — went code-only because
  config had to reference runtime objects (plugin modules); orca's one runtime
  object, the lint summariser agent, dissolves by convention (the flow
  supplies its own cheap tier; settings carry only the command).
- **A force-staged file is *less* durable than an untracked one.** `git reset
  --hard` (the failure-teardown step) deletes a staged-but-uncommitted file
  but leaves an untracked file alone. Anything orca writes for the user must
  therefore be written untracked, never pre-staged; it is written untracked
  and committed separately (or by the user).

Named presets (`preset = rust-cargo`) were considered and rejected: real
projects differ in subtle ways (extra cargo features, a nonstandard sbt
command, spotless vs no formatter at all), so a preset name is one indirection
away from the values users actually need to see and tweak — and a preset
catalog drifts (mill's format command changed syntax across 0.11/0.12/1.x).
Explicit per-task commands, auto-discovered and then owned by the user, keep
the file trivially editable.

## Decision

### The settings file

`{workDir}/.orca/settings.properties` — committed, hand-editable, key=value:

```properties
# orca stack settings — edit freely, commit with the project.
# Delete this file to re-run auto-discovery.
format = cargo fmt
format = pnpm exec prettier --write .
lint = cargo check --tests
lint = pnpm run lint
test = cargo test
```

- Keys: `format` (rewrite sources in place), `lint` (cheap sanity gate — a
  fast compile/check, not the test suite), `test` (full test run). A key may
  **repeat**: each occurrence appends to that task's command list, in file
  order (the example above is a Tauri-style repo with both a Rust and a JS
  half). All keys optional; a key with no occurrences means the task is
  disabled/unknown, and a key with an empty value is equivalent to omitting
  it. Each command runs via `bash -c` (so `&&` also composes within one
  value, when fail-fast between two commands is wanted).
- List semantics per task: `format` runs every command in order (each
  formatter owns its own files); `lint` runs every command, labels each
  output with its command and exit status (the zero-usually-means-clean hint
  the summariser relies on today), and feeds the concatenation to the one
  summariser pass — unlike `&&`-chaining, a failure in the first linter
  doesn't hide the second's diagnostics from the same review round — skipping
  the LLM round-trip only when every command's output is empty; `test` is a
  list the consuming flow runs as it sees fit.
- Parsing is a strict, tiny line format — `#` comments, `key = value`, the
  value taken verbatim (trimmed) after the first `=`. NOT
  `java.util.Properties`: its backslash/unicode escape handling would mangle
  shell commands. Unknown keys are an error naming the valid keys (typo
  detection; forward-compat traded away deliberately at 0.0.x, where consumers
  are version-pinned scripts).
- Read from `workDir` only — no upward search. In a monorepo, flows target a
  subproject; per-workDir settings are the correct semantics.

JSON (+ generated schema), HOCON, and TOML were all heavier than three shell
strings deserve; key=value needs no parser dependency, diffs cleanly, and
carries comments — the natural annotation here is *why* a command deviates
("--all-features because of feature-gated code"), which no schema hover text
can express.

### `.orca/` flips to committed-by-default

The settings file makes `.orca/` definitively mixed content, so the polarity
flips to the safe direction:

```
.orca/
  settings.properties      # committed project metadata
  progress-<hash>.json     # committed during runs (as today)
  cache/
    .gitignore             # written by orca, contains "*" (self-ignoring)
    CACHEDIR.TAG           # backup/sync tools skip the dir
    flow.lock
    lint-*.txt             # spilled lint output
```

- Ephemeral state moves under `.orca/cache/`, which orca creates with a
  self-ignoring `.gitignore` (`# Automatically created by orca.` + `*` — the
  ruff/pytest/virtualenv convention) and a `CACHEDIR.TAG` (beginning with the
  spec's `Signature: 8a477f597d28d172789f06886806bc55` line, or backup tools
  ignore it) — projects need
  zero gitignore lines, and a forgotten ignore fails *loudly* (untracked
  noise in `git status`) instead of silently losing a user's settings file.
  One shared helper owns creating `.orca` and `cache/` (today `FlowLock`,
  `Lint`, and `ProgressStore` each create `.orca` independently, and `Lint`
  resolves it against `os.pwd` where the others use `workDir` — reconciled
  while moving).
- The progress-log `forceAdd` **stays**. It is load-bearing, not a hack: in a
  repo that still gitignores `.orca/`, a plain stage `git add -A` would skip
  the log, and failure teardown's `reset --hard` would then leave an on-disk
  log claiming stages completed that were just reset away — a corrupt resume.
  On a non-ignored path, `add -f` degrades to a plain `add`, so keeping it is
  free.
- Migration: at flow start, if `git check-ignore` reports the settings path as
  ignored, log a prominent warning with the exact gitignore line to remove.
  Legacy repos keep working (force-add still carries the log); the settings
  file is the only casualty, and it is warned about on every run.
- `FlowLock` moves to `.orca/cache/flow.lock`; the `info/exclude` machinery
  is retired — `cache/.gitignore` is written by the same helper that creates
  the directory, before the lock, so the exclusion is always in place first.

### Auto-discovery

When `flow(...)` starts and no settings file exists (and no programmatic
override was passed), orca discovers the stack, **writes the file**, and
reports what it found (surfaced as flow events, like the other setup notes,
so non-terminal interactions see it too):

```
[orca] no .orca/settings.properties — running stack discovery
[orca]   format = cargo fmt              # Cargo.toml (rustfmt ships with the toolchain)
[orca]   lint   = cargo check --tests    # compiles main+test code, runs nothing
[orca]   test   = cargo test             # Cargo.toml; CI runs it in .github/workflows/ci.yml
[orca] written to .orca/settings.properties — review and edit as needed.
```

Discovery is one **read-only run of the leading agent's cheap tier** — the
same tier the lint summariser uses (`cheap.withReadOnly.resultAs[...]`, the
established text-in/JSON-out shape). The run is agentic: the agent reads
what it needs with its read-only tools; nothing is inlined into the prompt,
so repo size is bounded by the agent's own selective reading. The result
type is a private sibling of `StackSettings` that carries, per command, the
**evidence** that justifies it (the file — plus key, task, or line — that
shows the tool is set up here), and a one-line reason for each task left
unset. Evidence and reasons are written into the settings file as `#`
comment lines preceding each command line — they are what makes the post-hoc
"review and edit" step actually reviewable.

The prompt is **principle-based, with no catalog of real stack→command
examples**. Its elements:

- semantic definitions of the three tasks — in particular `lint` is defined
  by its properties (covers test sources, executes nothing, substantially
  faster than the suite; a compile/typecheck is usually right; never the
  test runner), not by the word "linter";
- a survey procedure: build definitions, lockfiles, task runners, tool
  configs, and **CI workflows** — CI shows which commands the project itself
  trusts, recovering calibrated commands from the repo rather than from the
  model's prior;
- prefer the project's own entry points over reconstructing them: a
  `justfile`/`Makefile` recipe, `package.json`/`composer.json` script, or
  build wrapper (`./gradlew`, `./mill`) encodes the project's opinion — emit
  `just fmt`, not the commands `just fmt` happens to run;
- configured-before-proposed: a tool being conventional for the ecosystem is
  NOT evidence; its config, plugin declaration, or script entry must be
  present in this repo — with one principled exception: a command bundled
  with the toolchain the build file already selects and designed to run
  with zero configuration is evidenced by that build file (in ecosystems
  whose formatter ships in the toolchain, config-absence carries no
  signal). The exception is stated in the prompt as a principle, with no
  real tool names, preserving the no-catalog stance;
- every command carries its evidence citation; no citable evidence → the
  task stays unset with a one-line reason, stated as a correct and complete
  answer (cheap models otherwise fill slots);
- multi-stack repos contribute commands per stack; orca's own flow scripts
  (`.sc` files pinning orca) are not part of the project's stack;
- exactly one **fictional-stack example** anchors the JSON shape and the
  lint-vs-test distinction (`acme compile --include-tests` vs `acme test`) —
  a made-up tool cannot leak into output as a runnable command.

Real-stack examples (a simplified form of the rejected matrix) were
considered and rejected as too suggestive: verbatim-copying bias is
quantified and worst on cheap tiers, and a seeded plausible command is the
one failure class nothing downstream catches — `sbt scalafmtAll` in a repo
without the plugin resolves on `PATH`, looks exactly canonical to a human
reviewing the file, and then fails or no-ops every review round. An
under-calibrated principle-derived command (`cargo check` missing `--tests`)
degrades visibly instead, and both cost the same one-line edit. A catalog in
the prompt would also anchor the model away from reading the repo —
reinstating the rejected matrix as a soft prior. Recorded escalation path:
if real use shows cheap tiers flubbing flag-level calibration on mainstream
stacks, add a single real example of the lint-vs-test *distinction* — never
per-stack rows.

Orca then applies two mechanical checks to each proposed command (orca-side
by necessity — the discovery agent's read-only toolset has no shell): its
first word — after stripping leading `VAR=` assignments — must resolve via
`bash -c 'command -v -- <word>'` (the execution environment's own
resolution, builtins included) or be an executable path inside the repo;
and each cited evidence file must exist. Failures are demoted to
commented-out lines carrying the failure reason
(`# lint = just check   (just: not found on PATH)`). The checks are
deliberately narrow — "resolves" is not "is right". A resolvable-but-wrong
guess is acceptable per the trusted-but-fallible stance: discovered commands
run inside stages with exactly the capability the coder agent's own shell
already has there, stage failure teardown bounds tree damage, and the guess
sits visibly in a committed file from its first run. The checks run once,
in the same process env stage-time `bash -c` inherits; the frozen file is
not re-checked on other machines, where a missing tool fails visibly at
stage time — consistent with freezing. The guesses are written to the file,
so a wrong one is a one-line edit, not a library fix — and the model call
happens **once**: the result is frozen in the committed file, and re-running
discovery means deleting it. The non-determinism of a model-driven guess is
confined to that first run.

A discovery **failure** — backend unavailable, spawn failure, structured
output still invalid after the retry policy — aborts the run as an ordinary
surfaced setup failure. It is deliberately *not* degraded to writing an
all-commented file: under the frozen-file semantics that would turn a
transient outage into a permanently recorded "gates off", and the run needs
the same backend minutes later anyway. (Contrast branch naming, which has a
deterministic fallback because a name must never block the flow; settings
have no safe deterministic fallback.)

An earlier draft specified a deterministic marker-file/probe matrix (per
ecosystem: markers, static capability probes, command tables) instead. It
was rejected after two review rounds found most of their defects inside that
matrix — plugin-specific gradle task names, config-filename variants, and a
self-detection bug where orca's flow scripts made every consumer repo look
like a scala-cli project. That is the maintenance profile of a hardcoded
catalog chasing every ecosystem's tooling forever; an agent reading the
actual repo has none of it, covers arbitrary stacks (CMake, Bazel, Elixir —
no out-of-the-box list to fall off of), and costs one cheap-model call on a
run that is about to spend minutes of model time anyway.

When the agent finds no evidence for a task (or for any stack at all), the
file is still written — the missing keys commented out, with the agent's
one-line reason (`# format = (no formatter config found)`) — and a warning is
logged that the corresponding gates are disabled. Recording the outcome in a
visible, committable file (rather than erroring, or silently re-detecting
every run) makes the "gates are off" state discoverable and the fix obvious.
Deleting the file re-runs discovery.

Discovery happens **eagerly, as a lifecycle setup step**, not lazily at first
use: a missing-settings surprise at the first `reviewAndFixLoop` would land
minutes into a run, after planning tokens are spent, and inside a stage whose
failure teardown discards uncommitted work. At setup time the cost of a wrong
outcome is one log line. When the file exists, discovery does not run at all —
an ordinary flow start reads the file and makes no model call. Running an
agent during setup is already established: the leading agent names the branch
in the same window.

Reading and validating an *existing* file happens before `ensureClean` — a
malformed file aborts before any tree mutation, and that pre-`ensureClean`
read also decides whether discovery runs (so a hand-written file that
`stash -u` sweeps out of a dirty tree is not mistaken for absent). Only the
discovery **write** is sequenced against `ensureClean`: it runs **after
`ensureClean`** (whose `stash -u` would stash a just-written untracked file
straight back out of the tree). The written file then gets its **own
dedicated commit** — `orca: stack settings (discovered)`, carrying exactly
that one path — on both lifecycle arms, so no later `add -A` sweep silently
carries it under an unrelated message. On the fresh arm the commit lands
**after the feature branch is created and immediately before the header
commit**, which therefore carries only the progress log its message names.
On a resumed run with no file (delete-to-rediscover, then resume), discovery
runs in the same post-`ensureClean` slot and the dedicated commit lands right
after the write — the branch already exists, so no header commit is involved.
The staging uses a **plain single-path `git add`** (not the log's force-add):
an ignored `.orca/` must stay ignored, so in a legacy repo that still ignores
`.orca/` the dedicated commit is **skipped outright** (`isIgnored` gate) and
the file simply stays untracked for the user to commit after fixing the
ignore — the per-run migration warning already covers it. The log's "review
and edit" is post-hoc — an edit-and-recommit, not a review gate.
Residual: a run failing in the narrow window between the write and its
dedicated commit leaves the file untracked, and the next run's `ensureClean`
stashes it with the usual dirty-tree warning before discovery re-runs —
spending a second model call and possibly guessing slightly differently.
Accepted: the window is a few git commands wide. A fresh run whose only
content turns out to be `.orca/` (no code landed) is torn down as a
throwaway branch, discarding the discovered settings with it — re-discovery
on the next run is the accepted cost.

### API

```scala
/** Resolved per-project tooling commands (each run via `bash -c`).
  * An empty list means the task is disabled/unknown. */
case class StackSettings(
    format: List[String] = Nil,
    lint: List[String] = Nil,
    test: List[String] = Nil
)
```

- `FlowContext` gains `def stackSettings: StackSettings` (not `settings` —
  too generic next to the context's other accessors), populated during the
  setup step sequenced above (override > file > discovery-and-write) and
  frozen for the run — context construction stays pure, preserving the
  runtime's construction-before-lifecycle invariant. A resumed run, or a
  separate process running against the same `workDir`, finds the now-written
  file and resolves to the same values.
- `flow(...)` gains `stackSettings: Option[StackSettings] = None`. When
  passed, the file is neither read nor written — the caller owns the values
  (this is the language-specific-flow escape hatch).
- No `SettingsReader` service trait: `GitTool`/`FsTool` are traits because
  they wrap subprocess state; reading one small file needs no seam. Tests
  write a real file into their temp `workDir` or pass the override.
- `reviewAndFixLoop`'s stack-dependent parameters become three-state so that
  *omission* means "from settings" while "explicitly off" stays expressible:

```scala
enum Configured[+A]:
  case FromSettings   // resolve from ctx.stackSettings (the default)
  case Off            // explicitly disabled for this call
  case Use(value: A)  // explicit value; settings ignored

def reviewAndFixLoop[B <: BackendTag](
    ...,
    formatCommands: Configured[List[String]] = Configured.FromSettings,
    lint: Configured[Lint] = Configured.FromSettings,
    ...
)
```

  `Lint` grows to `Lint(commands: List[String], agent)`: it runs each command,
  labels and concatenates the outputs, and keeps the single summariser pass.
  `FromSettings` resolves `format` directly and builds the lint gate as
  `Lint(stackSettings.lint, <lead agent>.cheap)` — the summariser tier every
  example currently hand-writes. An empty list resolves to no gate at all:
  `FromSettings` over an empty `stackSettings.lint` behaves exactly like
  `Off` (no `Lint` value constructed, no summariser wired), and an empty
  `stackSettings.format` formats nothing. `Configured` values are plain data, so the
  parameters remain compatible with the capture-checked `ReviewLoop` fan-out
  (ADR 0018 §6).
- The `test` key is not consumed by `reviewAndFixLoop` (the lint gate stays
  deliberately cheap); it is exposed via `ctx.stackSettings.test` for flows
  to use in their own verification stages, and discovery fills it so the file
  is complete when such a stage wants it.

Precedence, end to end: `reviewAndFixLoop(formatCommands = Use(...)/Off)` >
`flow(stackSettings = Some(...))` > `.orca/settings.properties` > auto-discovery
(which writes the file).

## Consequences

- Example scripts lose their last stack-specific lines;
  `reviewAndFixLoop(coderSession = session, reviewers = allReviewers(agent),
  task = ...)` works unchanged against a Rust, Scala, or Go repo.
- **Behavior change:** a script that today omits `lint` deliberately gets a
  lint gate the moment the target project's settings define one. At 0.0.x
  with version-pinned consumers this is accepted; scripts that want
  format-only pass `lint = Configured.Off`. Migration for explicit call
  sites: `formatCommand = Some("cargo fmt")` → `formatCommands =
  Use(List("cargo fmt"))`, `lint = Some(Lint(cmd, a))` → `lint =
  Use(Lint(List(cmd), a))`.
- New public surface: `StackSettings`, `Configured`, the
  `flow(stackSettings = …)` parameter, the settings-file format, and the
  discovery behaviour (documented in the README).
- `.orca/` becomes committed-by-default with `cache/` scratch; repos that
  keep their old `.orca/` ignore line get a per-run warning naming the line
  to remove. The `info/exclude` lock mechanism is retired; a stale
  `.orca/flow.lock` line may linger in existing repos'
  `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/info/exclude` — harmless, since the lock now lives under
  the self-ignored `cache/`.
- Discovery guesses are visible and cheap to correct (edit the file).
  First-run discovery needs a working agent backend and spends one
  cheap-model call; runs with an existing settings file — the steady state,
  including CI — make no model call.
- Not in scope, recorded as non-goals: named presets, a user-level
  (`~/.config/orca`) settings layer (no machine-scoped read site exists yet),
  per-flow-type profiles, upward/monorepo settings search, and Windows
  support beyond the pre-existing `bash -c` contract.
