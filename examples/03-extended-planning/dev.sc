/** Extended planning flow with a markdown-backed, resumable plan.
  *
  * The plan lives in `dev.md` at the root of the working directory.
  * On a fresh run the agent generates it; on a resume the existing
  * file is reused and execution restarts from the first incomplete
  * task. Each task's `Status: [x]` checkbox is committed back to
  * `dev.md` after the task lands, so a crash mid-flow doesn't lose
  * progress.
  *
  * At the end of a successful run the documentation step updates
  * the project README based on what changed, and the plan file is
  * removed (committed as the wrap-up).
  *
  * Run from the project's working directory:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run <orca-sandbox>/examples/03-extended-planning/dev.sc -- \
  *   "Add a divide method to Calculator with full test coverage"
  * ```
