/** Autonomous planning + coding flow that lands the work on its own branch and
  * opens a pull request.
  *
  * Same backbone as `implement.sc` (autonomous planning → per-task implement
  * + review-and-fix loop), enhanced with a self-review pass on the plan:
  *
  *   1. **`.reviewed(agent)`** — the planner critiques its own draft and
  *      returns an improved plan (missing/duplicated tasks, ordering, vague
  *      descriptions, steps that don't fit the code). Runs read-only on the
  *      planning session; no extra exploration cost.
  *
  * In addition, the plan always carries a `brief` — a codebase summary the
  * planner writes as part of its structured output. It seeds the implementer
  * session so the cold-starting coding agents don't re-discover what the
  * planner already learned.
  *
  * The flow runtime handles the feature branch automatically: it creates a
  * branch from the prompt, commits progress to the stage log, and returns to
  * the starting branch on success. Resume is stage-log based — a re-run with
  * the same prompt continues from the first incomplete stage.
  *
  * On success the flow:
  *
  *   1. Pushes the feature branch.
  *   1. Opens a PR with a haiku-generated title + description from the full
  *      branch diff. A human picks the PR up from there.
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run implement-enhanced.sc -- "Add a multiply function to the calculator crate"
  * ```
  *
  * The review loop's format and lint commands come from
  * `.orca/settings.properties`, auto-discovered on first run — the script
  * itself stays stack-agnostic.
  *
  * Requires `claude` logged in, `cargo` on PATH, and `gh` authenticated.
