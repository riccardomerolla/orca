# Example 01 — simple in-memory flow

The minimum-viable Orca flow: ask the agent to plan, then implement
each task in sequence with a review-and-fix loop.

The plan lives entirely in memory for one run — there's no plan file,
no resume, no on-disk state beyond the git commits the flow produces.
Use this when the task is small enough to finish in one session.

## What it does

1. **Plan.** The agent receives the user's prompt and returns a
   structured `Plan(tasks: List[Task])` (one interactive turn). The
   `Announce[Plan]` instance auto-summarises it on the event bus —
   no explicit `plan.announce` call needed.
2. **For each task:**
   - Create the task's branch.
   - Hand the task's prompt to the agent (continuing the planning
     session).
   - Commit.
   - Run `reviewAndFixLoop` with `defaultReviewers(claude)`.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 21+, [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/).
- `claude` logged in (see the repo root README).
- `com.virtuslab::orca:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT` published locally:

  ```bash
  cd <orca-sandbox>
  sbt publishLocal
  ```

- `cargo` on PATH — the seed is a small Rust crate so the lint
  command is `cargo test --quiet`. Swap the `lintCommand` line in
  `ship.sc` if you point the flow at a non-Rust project.
- A target project to run against. The sibling
  [`create-test-project.sh`](create-test-project.sh) seeds a
  tiny Rust calculator crate from the [`test-project/`](test-project/)
  directory into a temp dir and inits git:

  ```bash
  ./examples/01-simple/create-test-project.sh
  # → "Test project ready at: /tmp/orca-01-simple-…"
  ```

  Edit `test-project/` if you want a different starter.

## Run

The seed script prints the exact `scala-cli run` line to invoke;
in shape it's:

```bash
scala-cli run <path-to-orca>/examples/01-simple/ship.sc -- \
  "Add a multiply function to the calculator crate"
```
