/** Run an epic: a multi-task workstream with cross-agent review.
  *
  * Two layers are stacked here:
  *
  * 1. **The epic is on disk.** `epic.md` at the working-directory
  *    root holds the task list; on a fresh run the agent
  *    generates it, on a resume the existing file is reused and
  *    execution restarts from the first incomplete task. Each
  *    task's `Status: [x]` checkbox is committed back to `epic.md`
  *    as the task lands, so a crash mid-flow loses no progress.
  *
  * 2. **Each task is reviewed by both backends.** After Claude
  *    implements a task, `defaultReviewers(claude)` *and*
  *    `defaultReviewers(codex)` run in parallel against the same
  *    diff. Disagreement is the point — when one backend misses a
  *    bug the other catches, the task doesn't ship until the
  *    agent has fixed it. This needs both `claude` and `codex`
  *    CLIs logged in.
  *
  * At the end of a successful run the documentation step updates
  * the project README based on what changed, and the epic file is
  * removed (committed as the wrap-up).
  *
  * Lives alongside the seeded todo-cli project so a user can run
  * it from the project's root after
  * `examples/03-epic/create-test-project.sh`:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run epic.sc -- \
  *   "Persist tasks to a JSON file at ~/.todo/tasks.json (load on startup, save on every change), \
  *    add 'done <id>' and 'delete <id>' commands, and support priority levels (low/medium/high) \
  *    with a 'list --priority' filter"
  * ```
