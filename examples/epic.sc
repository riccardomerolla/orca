/** Run an epic: a multi-task workstream with cross-agent review.
  *
  * Two layers stack here:
  *
  *   - **On-disk epic.** `.orca/plan-<hash>.md` holds the task list — generated
  *     on a fresh run, recovered on a resume (pending edits stashed, branch
  *     re-attached) to restart from the first incomplete task. Each task's
  *     `Status: [x]` is committed as the task lands, so a crash loses no
  *     progress.
  *   - **Cross-agent review.** Claude implements; codex reviews — the
  *     implementer is its own worst critic, so a separate model widens coverage
  *     cheaply. Fixes go back to the same Claude session. Both CLIs must be
  *     logged in.
  *
  * On success the plan file is removed, then a docs step updates the README
  * based on what changed.
  *
  * Run it from a git repository, with `claude` and `codex` logged in:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run epic.sc -- \
  *   "Persist tasks to a JSON file at ~/.todo/tasks.json (load on startup, save on every change), \
  *    add 'done <id>' and 'delete <id>' commands, and support priority levels (low/medium/high) \
  *    with a 'list --priority' filter"
  * ```
