/** Run an epic: a multi-task workstream with cross-agent review.
  *
  * Two layers stack here:
  *
  *   - **Resumable stages.** The stage log (`.orca/progress-<hash>.json`) tracks
  *     the plan and every completed task. A re-run with the same prompt resumes
  *     from the first incomplete stage — the plan is not re-generated, already
  *     finished tasks are skipped, and the implementer session is reseeded from
  *     the recorded brief.
  *   - **Cross-agent review.** Claude (opus) plans and implements; codex reviews
  *     — the implementer is its own worst critic, so a separate model widens
  *     coverage cheaply. Fixes go back to the same Claude session. Both CLIs
  *     must be logged in.
  *
  * On success a docs step updates the README based on what changed.
  *
  * The review loop's format and lint commands come from
  * `.orca/settings.properties`, auto-discovered on first run — the script
  * itself stays stack-agnostic.
  *
  * Run it from a git repository, with `claude` and `codex` logged in:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run epic.sc -- \
  *   "Persist tasks to a JSON file at ~/.todo/tasks.json (load on startup, save on every change), \
  *    add 'done <id>' and 'delete <id>' commands, and support priority levels (low/medium/high) \
  *    with a 'list --priority' filter"
  * ```
