/** Interactive planning + coding flow.
  *
  * Same shape as `implement.sc`, but the planner can drive a conversation: on
  * an underspecified prompt it calls the `ask_user` tool to clarify before
  * producing the plan. Progress and resume work identically — the stage log
  * (`.orca/progress-<hash>.json`) is the sole resume mechanism. An interactive
  * planning stage that already completed is replayed from its recorded result
  * without re-prompting on a re-run.
  *
  * `examples/runnable/02-interactive/create-test-project.sh` seeds the
  * calculator crate into a temp dir and copies this script alongside it;
  * from there:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run implement-interactive.sc -- "Add a new arithmetic operation to the calculator crate. Ask the user which."
  * ```
  *
  * The trailing "Ask the user which." pushes the planner to call `ask_user`
  * rather than guessing.
  *
  * The review loop's format and lint commands come from
  * `.orca/settings.properties`, auto-discovered on first run — the script
  * itself stays stack-agnostic.
  *
  * Requires `claude` logged in and `cargo` on PATH.
