/** Bugfix flow: red-test-first, against a real PR.
  *
  * Given a bug report (the user's prompt), the flow:
  *
  *   1. Triages the bug — interactively asks the agent whether a
  *      failing test can reproduce it, what the reproduction steps
  *      are otherwise, and where to put any reproduction artefact.
  *   2. Writes the failing artefact (a unit test if possible, a
  *      `REPRODUCTION.md` otherwise) and commits it.
  *   3. Pushes a branch, opens a PR.
  *   4. Waits for CI to come back red — fails the stage if CI was
  *      green (the agent claimed the test reproduced; CI says
  *      otherwise).
  *   5. Comments on the PR with the failing-test output, and asks
  *      the agent to confirm the failure matches the original
  *      report. Fails the stage on a mismatch.
  *   6. Implements the fix on the same branch. Reviews + lints.
  *   7. Pushes the fix; waits for CI to go green.
  *
  * Run from the bugged project's working directory:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run <orca-sandbox>/examples/02-bugfix/bugfix.sc -- \
  *   "Calculator.add returns a wrong value when one argument is Integer.MIN_VALUE"
  * ```
  *
  * Requires `claude` and `gh` both authenticated; the target repo
  * must have a CI workflow that runs the test suite.
