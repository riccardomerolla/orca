/** Bug-report → fix flow for Scala projects, autonomous.
  *
  * Given a `<owner>/<repo>#<number>` reference to a Scala-project issue, the
  * flow:
  *
  *   1. Reads the issue from GitHub (pure read, outside any stage).
  *   1. Triages: actually a bug? can a unit test reproduce it?
  *      - Not a bug → posts the verdict on the issue. The throwaway branch (no
  *        code committed) is auto-deleted by the runtime on exit.
  *      - Bug, but not testable → posts reproduction steps on the issue and
  *        stops (no PR for docs-only repros). Same branch cleanup.
  *   1. For a testable bug:
  *      a. "Write failing test" stage: writes and commits the test. b. "Push +
  *         open tentative PR" stage: pushes the committed test, then opens a PR
  *         (`gh.createPr` is idempotent by branch). These are two separate
  *         stages because a stage commits only on completion — a push in the
  *         same stage as the edit would push nothing (ADR 0018 §3.2 R8).
  *   1. Waits for CI to go red (pure polling read, outside a stage). Fails
  *      loudly on green — the reproduction is wrong.
  *   1. Confirms the failure matches the report.
  *   1. Plans + implements the fix on the same branch (each task a stage).
  *   1. "Push fix + finalise PR" stage: pushes the fix and regenerates the PR
  *      title + description from the full branch diff.
  *
  * The feature branch is named deterministically from the issue number
  * (`fix/issue-<n>`), so a re-run after a crash lands on the same branch.
  * Resume is stage-log based — each completed stage is skipped on a re-run.
  *
  * The flow reads top-to-bottom below; the per-step helper methods it calls
  * (`confirmReproductionMatches`, `planAndImplementFix`, `prSummary`) are
  * defined at the bottom of the file.
  *
  * Usage:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run issue-pr-bugfix.sc -- "acme/widgets#42"
  * ```
  *
  * The review loop's format commands come from `.orca/settings.properties`,
  * auto-discovered on first run; the lint gate is pinned explicitly below to
  * demonstrate the per-call override.
  *
  * Requires `claude` and `gh` authenticated; target repo must have a CI
  * workflow that runs `sbt test`.
