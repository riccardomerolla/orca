/** Bug-report → fix flow for Scala projects, autonomous.
  *
  * Given a `<owner>/<repo>#<number>` reference to a Scala-project issue, the
  * flow:
  *
  *   1. Reads the issue from GitHub.
  *   1. Triages: actually a bug? can a unit test reproduce it?
  *       - Not a bug → comment the verdict on the issue and stop.
  *       - Bug, but not testable → comment reproduction steps on the issue
  *         and stop (no PR for docs-only repros).
  *   1. For a testable bug: write the failing test, push, open a PR with a
  *      tentative haiku-generated description noting only the failing test
  *      has landed.
  *   1. Wait `CiTimeout` for CI to go red — fail loudly on green (the
  *      reproduction is wrong).
  *   1. Sonnet inspects the failed run via `gh` (the flow never reads the
  *      log into memory) and posts a short focused failure comment, then
  *      verifies the failure matches the report — also via `gh`, by run id.
  *   1. Plan + implement the fix on the same branch (read/grep, write,
  *      `sbt scalafmtAll`, review per task). Implementation reuses the
  *      triage/failing-test session.
  *   1. Push the fix, then regenerate the PR title + description from the
  *      full branch diff (so it reads as a fix, not "add a test"). Does NOT
  *      wait for CI green at the end — a human picks the PR up from there.
  *
  * Usage:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run issue-pr-bugfix.sc -- "acme/widgets#42"
  * ```
  *
  * Requires `claude` and `gh` authenticated; target repo must have a CI
  * workflow that runs `sbt test`.
