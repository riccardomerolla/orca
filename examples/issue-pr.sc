/** GitHub-issue → PR flow, fully autonomous.
  *
  * Given a `<owner>/<repo>#<number>` reference (the user's prompt), the flow:
  *
  *   1. Reads the issue from GitHub (title, body, author) — outside any stage,
  *      since it is a pure read.
  *   1. Skeptically assesses the report against the repo (claims, missing
  *      detail, duplicates, scope) and either proceeds with a plan or rejects.
  *   1. On rejection: posts the agent's reply on the issue. The throwaway
  *      branch (no code committed) is auto-deleted by the runtime on exit.
  *   1. On proceed: runs the per-task implement + review-and-fix loop. The
  *      task list and progress live in the stage log; a re-run resumes from
  *      the first incomplete stage.
  *   1. Pushes the branch, folds the diff into a PR title + description via
  *      haiku (`summarisePr`), and opens the PR via `gh` (idempotent by branch).
  *
  * The feature branch is named deterministically from the issue number
  * (`fix/issue-<n>`), so a re-run after a crash lands on the same branch.
  *
  * Usage — pass `<owner>/<repo>#<number>`:
  *
  * ```bash
  * scala-cli run issue-pr.sc -- "acme/widgets#42"
  * ```
  *
  * The review loop's format and lint commands come from
  * `.orca/settings.properties`, auto-discovered on first run — the script
  * itself stays stack-agnostic.
  *
  * Requires `claude` and `gh` both authenticated.
