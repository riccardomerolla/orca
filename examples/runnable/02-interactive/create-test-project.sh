# Seeds the calculator Rust crate for example 02-interactive into a
# temp directory (or a path you supply) and inits a git repo so the
# flow has something to commit against. The seed files live in the
# sibling `test-project/` directory — edit those, not the script, if
# you want the starter to look different.
#
# The companion flow (`examples/implement-interactive.sc`) uses
# `Plan.interactive.from`, so the planner can call the `ask_user` MCP
# tool to clarify an underspecified prompt before producing the plan.
#
# Usage:
#   examples/runnable/02-interactive/create-test-project.sh                    # mktemp, Maven Central
#   examples/runnable/02-interactive/create-test-project.sh /path/to/dir       # explicit dest
#   examples/runnable/02-interactive/create-test-project.sh --local            # publishLocal + pin
#   examples/runnable/02-interactive/create-test-project.sh --run              # seed, then run it
#   examples/runnable/02-interactive/create-test-project.sh --settings         # seed stack settings too
#   examples/runnable/02-interactive/create-test-project.sh --local /path/...  # combinable

The trailing "Ask the user which." pushes the planner to call ask_user
rather than guessing the operation. Type the answer at the prompt and
the conversation continues.
