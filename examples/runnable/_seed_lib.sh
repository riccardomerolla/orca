# Passing `--local` to the example script swaps Maven Central for the
# local ivy cache: `sbt publishLocal` runs in the orca checkout, and the
# copied flow script gets its `using dep` pinned to the freshly-published
# dynver version plus an extra `using repository ivy2Local` line.

Usage: $(basename "$0") [--local] [--run] [--settings] [<dest>]

  --local     Resolve org.virtuslab::orca from a local 'sbt publishLocal'
              instead of Maven Central. Runs publishLocal in the orca repo
              root, then patches the generated flow script with the current
              dynver-derived version and 'using repository ivy2Local'.
  --run       After seeding, cd into the project and run the example's
              'scala-cli run ...' command with the suggested prompt (instead
              of just printing it). Not supported for examples that need a
              GitHub repo + issue set up first.
  --settings  Seed a ready '.orca/settings.properties' with the starter's
              format/lint/test commands, committed with the project, so a
              run skips the stack auto-discovery model call. Useful for
              offline or deterministic runs.
  <dest>      Destination directory (defaults to a fresh mktemp).
