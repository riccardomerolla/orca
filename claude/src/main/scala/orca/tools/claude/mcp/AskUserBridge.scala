  * worker thread that needs a string answer to return to the agent) and the
  * host process (the conversation driver that emits `UserQuestion` events
  * and feeds back what the user typed).
  *
  * One queue carries `(question, reply)` pairs from the handler side; each
  * call brings its own private reply channel so concurrent `ask_user`
  * invocations from a busy agent don't cross wires. The handler thread
  * blocks on its reply channel until the host signals it; the host's
  * consumer loop takes from the question queue, surfaces a `UserQuestion`,
  * and calls the `respond` closure with the typed answer.
  *
  * Lifecycle: created per [[orca.backend.Conversation]]. The consumer fork
  * lives in the same supervised scope as the conversation; scope-end
  * interrupts both [[ask]] and [[take]] callers via Ox's standard channel
  * cancellation.
