# Orca

**Describe what you want, ship it.** Orca turns a one-line prompt into a
sequence of concrete coding tasks, implements each one through an LLM coding
agent (Claude Code today, Codex on the way), reviews the changes with a pod of
specialist reviewers, and opens a PR — all driven by a small, explicit script
you control.

## How it works

You write a short flow script describing the *shape* of your development
loop. Orca handles the orchestration:

1. **Plan.** A planning LLM reads your prompt, consults the codebase, and
   produces a structured list of subtasks — each with a branch name and a
   description. You can review the plan interactively before anything is
   committed.
2. **Implement.** For every subtask, Orca asks the coding agent to make the
   change on a fresh git branch. The agent edits files, runs tests, and
   commits.
3. **Review.** A configurable pod of reviewer agents (performance, readability,
   test coverage by default; or your own) evaluates the diff in parallel.
   Issues above a confidence threshold go back to the coder for a fix; the
   loop continues until the reviewers are happy or a cap is hit.
4. **Ship.** Orca opens a pull request, waits for CI, and leaves a summary of
   any issues the reviewers explicitly decided to accept.

Because the flow is plain code (loops, conditionals, types) you can change any
of it: swap backends, add a Slack approval stage, run lints, skip planning
when the prompt already names a specific file, feed the task list from JIRA.

## A full flow

Save this as `ship.sc` and run it with your task:

```scala
//> using dep "com.virtuslab::orca:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
//> using repository ivy2Local
//> using jvm 21

import orca.{*, given}

case class Task(branchName: String, description: String) derives JsonData

case class Plan(tasks: List[Task]) derives JsonData

// `args` is scala-cli's script argv; `OrcaArgs.from` parses the
// positional prompt and flags. For scripts with no CLI input, bare
// `flow: ...` also works and leaves `userPrompt` as the empty string.
flowWith(args = OrcaArgs.from(args.toSeq)):
  // 1. Break the user's prompt into concrete subtasks, interactively.
  val (sessionId, plan) = stage("plan"):
    claude.resultAs[Plan].interactive(userPrompt)

  // 2. Implement each task on its own branch and review locally.
  for task <- plan.tasks do
    stage(s"implement: ${task.description}"):
      git.createBranch(task.branchName)
      claude.continueSession(sessionId, s"Implement ${task.description}")
      git.commit(s"Implement ${task.description}")

      reviewAndFixLoop(
        coder = claude,
        sessionId = sessionId,
        reviewers = defaultReviewers(claude),
        task = task.description,
        lintCommand = Some("sbt scalafmtCheckAll test")
      )
```

The `{*, given}` selector is load-bearing: plain `import orca.*` leaves
Scala 3's given instances behind, and the flow DSL relies on them to bridge
`derives JsonData` to the underlying Schema and codec during macro
expansion. The rest is just Scala — if you need to override a tool, use
`flowWith(git = Some(myGit)): ...` instead of bare `flow:`.

```bash
scala-cli run ship.sc -- "Add a rate-limiter to the /login endpoint"
```

While Orca runs, the terminal shows the active stage and an animated
orca-and-wave indicator while the agent is thinking. Interactive stages (like
planning) hand the tty to Claude directly so you can steer; autonomous stages
stream progress back through the event bus.

## What you need

- **Java 21+** (Orca uses virtual threads).
- **[scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/)** to run the flow script.
- **[claude](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code)** — the Claude Code
  CLI, signed in (`claude auth login`).
- **[gh](https://cli.github.com/)** — the GitHub CLI, signed in (`gh auth
  login`). Only needed if your flow calls `gh.createPr`, `gh.waitForBuild`,
  etc.

That's it. There's no runtime to install, no long-lived service to manage;
each flow run is one `scala-cli` process.

## Getting set up

Orca isn't on Maven Central yet. Until it is, one bootstrap step publishes the
artifacts to your local cache so `scala-cli` can resolve them:

```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd orca-sandbox
sbt publishLocal            # first time only
```

After that you're done — run flow scripts directly with `scala-cli`:

```bash
scala-cli run ship.sc -- "your task here"
```

## Status

Under active development. The planning, coding, review-and-fix loop, Claude
backend, and terminal UI are all working end-to-end. Codex support and Maven
Central publishing are the remaining pieces — see [`plan.md`](plan.md) for
the epic-level breakdown.

## Documentation

- [`design.md`](design.md) — full architecture and design rationale.
- [`plan.md`](plan.md) — development plan with per-epic status.

## Developing Orca

Orca is implemented in Scala 3 on top of [Ox](https://ox.softwaremill.com/)
for structured concurrency, [tapir](https://tapir.softwaremill.com/) for JSON
Schema derivation, and [jsoniter-scala](https://github.com/plokhotnyuk/jsoniter-scala)
for codec generation. To hack on it you also need **sbt 1.12+** in addition
to the runtime requirements above.

### Project layout

```
orca/
├── build.sbt / project/
├── tools/      # tool interfaces + os-backed impls + structured I/O + event bus
├── flow/       # FlowContext, stage/fail/fixLoop/reviewAndFixLoop/lint, review types
├── claude/     # Claude Code backend + DefaultClaudeTool + DefaultLlmCall
├── codex/      # Codex backend (skeleton, Epic 9)
└── runner/     # flow() entry + DefaultFlowContext + terminal layer
```

Dependency graph:

```
tools   (standalone)
  ├── flow       → tools
  ├── claude     → tools
  ├── codex      → tools
  └── runner     → tools + flow + claude + codex
```

The runner module owns the `flow` entry point (`package orca`) and wires
defaults via `DefaultFlowContext` (`package orca.runner`). Its terminal UI
lives in its own sub-package, `orca.runner.terminal`, so swapping it for a
Slack or HTTP equivalent is a matter of substituting one `Interaction` at the
call site rather than rewiring modules.

Only the user-facing surface lives in `package orca` (the `flow`/`flowWith`
entry points, the tool traits, the accessors, `JsonData`, `OrcaArgs`).
Implementations live in focused subpackages: `orca.tools.fs` /
`orca.tools.git` / `orca.tools.github` (os-backed tool impls),
`orca.tools.claude` / `orca.tools.codex` (LLM backends), `orca.subprocess`
(subprocess shim), `orca.io` (structured-I/O plumbing), `orca.runner` /
`orca.runner.terminal` (wiring and terminal UI).

### Build and test

```bash
sbt compile                             # build every module
sbt test                                # unit tests across all modules
sbt "flow/test"                         # scope to one module
sbt "flow/testOnly orca.FixLoopTest"    # scope to one suite
```

Compiler warnings are treated as errors (`-Wunused:all`, `-Wvalue-discard`,
`-Wnonunit-statement`).

### Formatting

```bash
sbt scalafmtAll                         # reformat every source in place
sbt scalafmtCheckAll                    # fail if anything would reformat
```

### Integration tests (gated)

Some tests shell out to real external tools and skip by default:

```bash
ORCA_INTEGRATION=1 sbt test

ORCA_INTEGRATION=1 sbt "claude/testOnly orca.claude.ClaudeIntegrationTest"
ORCA_INTEGRATION=1 sbt "tools/testOnly orca.tools.OsGitHubIntegrationTest"
ORCA_INTEGRATION=1 sbt "runner/testOnly orca.runner.terminal.ScalaCliSmokeTest"
```

| Suite | Needs |
|---|---|
| `ClaudeIntegrationTest` | `claude` authenticated |
| `OsGitHubIntegrationTest` | `gh` authenticated |
| `ScalaCliSmokeTest` | `scala-cli`; runs `sbt publishLocal` internally |

Unit tests use in-memory fakes (`StubCliRunner`, `FakeLlmTool`,
`FakeCliProcess`, `TestFlowContext`) — no network, no real filesystem outside
of `os.temp.dir()`.

### Iterating quickly

- `sbt --client <cmd>` talks to a persistent sbt server; round-trips drop
  from ~20s to ~2s.
- `sbt ~test` re-runs tests on save.
- Metals MCP is configured (`.metals/mcp.json`), so AI-assisted tooling can
  query real type info across modules.

### Conventions

- Braceless syntax; explicit return types on every public member.
- No class-level `var`s; mutable state is confined to method bodies or
  `AtomicReference`-guarded test helpers.
- Ox for structured concurrency; `.handle*` (not `.serverLogic*`) for Tapir
  endpoints.
- Tests target exactly one scenario each.

The `direct-style-scala` plugin codifies these; re-reading its chapters
before a non-trivial change is recommended.

### Publishing locally

```bash
sbt publishLocal
```

Installs `com.virtuslab::orca:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT` plus its transitive modules
(`orca-tools`, `orca-flow`, `orca-claude`, `orca-codex`) into
`~/.ivy2/local` so a flow script with `//> using repository ivy2Local` can
resolve them.

For an iteration loop while hacking on Orca itself, run sbt in one terminal
with a `~` watch-and-publish:

```bash
sbt "~publishLocal"
```

Every save rebuilds the affected module and refreshes `~/.ivy2/local`. In a
second terminal, re-run a flow script with Coursier's cache bypassed so the
freshly-published snapshot is picked up:

```bash
scala-cli run --ttl 0 examples/spinner-demo.scala
```
